# Imagej-Histological-Analysis
Jython code to separate different part of histological tissues for a quantifiable analysis


This code separates H&E tissue from the white background, as well as separating it from veins and arteries. 

To be added: 
- Separation of nuclei and cytoplasm
- Option to export segmented parts to tables
- Nicer, more understandable formatting
